# Game-Design-and-Development

This module has taught me about the design and development of games within an existing game engine by exploring the following topics:

• Game development using assets within a game engine and associated development environment.
• Games programming with a high-level object-oriented programming language
• Game design theory, covering level design, challenge and agency, game mechanics, game narratives
• Iterative design and development incorporating playtesting and games user research

For this module we had to work in a group in order to create an interactive game in Unity 3D. 
Our game is a first person tower defense where the player has to the enemy waves in order to win. I was tasked with creating the character movement and the level design.

Here is some gameplay of our finished product.
